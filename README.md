## Probabilistic Machine Learning

*NOTE-* Study notes for this repository are a little sparse as I was juggling between things during my reading.

This repository is a collection of study material for the book [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf) by Kevin Murphy. Notes are constructed on a chapter-by-chapter basis with the former containing only the essential components from chapters.
